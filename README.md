<h1>NecroBot-Tustin - a fork of the defunct NecroBot with new features.</h1>

The original NecroBot project was removed for unknown reasons, so I merged my other forked repo (one that was actually considered a forked repository) with this one again since I don't need to update from their repo anymore. This bot will be updated periodically with new features and optimizations.

<h2><a name="credits">Credits</a></h2>
A big thank you goes to Ferox's hard work on the API & Console. Without him, this would not have been possible. Also a big thanks to the original NecroBot team and contributers (you can see most of them in the "Contributors" tab on this repo).
